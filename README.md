# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

/_ This is my first ever React project done complete by myself,
without the use of any tutorials or Youtube videos.
I did reference the documentations for some libraries on the odd occasion.
There is still a lot to improve, but the task for this project was to practice
all the knowledge I had gathered so far and use it in a real project.
The premise is simple, a to-do app, but I added some complex functions (complex to me),
like react-router, back-end server (firebase) and a styling library (bootstrap).
I initially wanted to add Redux toolkit as well, but soon noticed it might make the
app unnecessarily complex, so instead decided to showcase my Redux skills in another app.
There are still some things I'm not pleased with, and I had to come up with sub-par solutions
to make the page re-render in some cases (which you might notice if you take a look at
the dependencies for both useEffect methods, or a quick look at the console).
Also left an error in the console that 2 <a> can't be nested inside each other,
but I left it that way to avoid issues with styling. One last thing, i know
the CSS modules were unnecessary, since I use minimum styling and get most of my styling
from Bootstrap, and it would have even been better to just use one App.css, especially
since I reuse the same elements in almost all components, but nonetheless I decided
to use them to show I know how to (or maybe that actually shows I don't know how to use them correctly?).
Anyway, had a blast making this, took me about 5-6 hours for the whole project, quite
proud of myself if I do say so myself, hope you like it!
